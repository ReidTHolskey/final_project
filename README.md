Final Project for ECE 287

For our project, we decided to clone the classic game Brick Breaker using verilog. The game is played on an FPGA board using the keys KEY[1] and KEY[2]. The goal of the game is to clear all of the red bricks from the screen. In order to accomplish this goal, a user must hit a moving ball by moving a paddle up and down. If the user fails to hit the ball, they will be met with a red screen, and they must restart the game by pressing KEY[0]. If the user successfully clears all of the bricks, they will be met with a green screen, indicating that they have won the game. Located in the Wiki is a high level description of how we went about creating our game.
